/*

const is no changeable after define
only have 1 method to declare constant


difference btw var and let :
1)
var: it ignor block scope so we can access through whole code
let: not accessible out of function

2)
var: print without define ---> undefined and go ahead
let: print without define ---> print syntex error

3)
var: redeclaration is possible it take value which is in last
let: redeclaratioin is not possible it say --->  SyntaxError: Identifier 'name' has already been declared
 
accountCity = "jaipur"  is also used for variable but it is not recommanded



*********** use LET always

console.table([]) is used to print all things in one table form
